    -> Implemented Set Difference using MapReduce <br />
  -> Spark <br />
    -> Counted occurences of keywords for each month and year in the provided blog corpus using Spark transformations <br />

Description: <br />
  -> Divided a satellite image into 500x500 sub-images and computed its feature vector using gradient in X and Y directions. <br />
  -> Computed signature of feature vector and used LSH to find similarity candidates for some query images. <br />
  -> Implemented approximate SVD to transform feature vector to low dimensional space. <br />
  -> Computed distances between similar images in the low dimensional subspace. <br />
